Svelte component that displays an image and pivots it with the users face, as detected by the webcam.

Still a work in progress, but the basic functionality is there on the GitHub page.

Must give webcam permissions for it to work. No data is stored or sent anywhere, feel free to check the code yourself.

Well actually the GH Pages is broken rn, but local copies should work
